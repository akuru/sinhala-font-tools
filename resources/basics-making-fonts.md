### Font editor softwares

Vector editing tools like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator or CoralDraw are not fit for the job of drawing fonts or producing fonts. Font editors are software programmes specifically designed and developed for producing font files. 

There is a practise of drawing the outlines in a vector programme and then importing them into a font editor. This is prctise is time consuming, less productive and produces low quality fonts. Even if you are making a font just for fun, you should work with a font editor program as it provides tools and features specifically geared for font making.
